1). Express JS - minimilistic framework in node JS for creating apis
 - Step 1. Install node - npm i express
 - Step 2. import express in our project
 - Step 3. create server using express()

 - example
    let express = require('express')
    let server = express()
    server.get('./',(req, res) => {
        res.send("<h1>Hello World!!</h1>")
    })
    server.listen(8080)

2). There are many types of method to request but only 5 methods used commonly
    - get, post, put, delete, patch
    - get for getting data
    - post for creating data
    - put and patch for updating data
    - delete for deleting data
We used this methods for CRUD operation in backend

3). middleware - it is a process to do something before the request is sent to server or certain API. There is many types of middleware we can create middleware on application level or certain routes etc
-- example of custom middleware in app level :- 
    server.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log(req.ip, req.method, req.hostname, new Date, req.get("User-agent"))
        next()
    })
    - It runs whenever ther is any request on server

-- example of custom middleware on certain route
    const auth = ((req, res, next) => {
        console.log(req.query)
        if(req.query.password == "123") {
            next()
        } else {
            res.sendStatus(401)
        }
    })

    server.get('/',auth,(req,res) => {
        res.json({type: "GET"})
    })
    - It will only run on ./ request

-- example of inbuilt middleware 
    1). server.use(express.json()) - used to read json data from body request
    2). server.use(express.urlencoded())
    3). server.use(express.static('public')) - For static hosting

- there is other types of third party middleware available as well

4). types to get data in server from clients

    - req.body - mostly sent data from form comes in req.body. this data type comes hidden from url 
    - req.query - data when there is query parameter can be access with this method like ?password=123
    - req.params - like url parameter
